# Contributing to JS Chess Engine

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the JS Chess Engine! This project welcomes contributions from both human developers and AI agents. We follow an **Issue-Driven Development** approach where all work is tracked through GitHub Issues.

## üéØ Development Philosophy

### Core Principles

- **Issue-Driven Development** - All work must be tracked through GitHub Issues
- **Modular Architecture** - Maintain clean separation between core, UI, AI, and utility components
- **AI-First Design** - Code should be optimized for both human and AI agent collaboration
- **Quality First** - Comprehensive testing and code quality standards are non-negotiable

### Project Goals

- Create a pure JavaScript chess engine that surpasses the original Atari Video Chess
- Implement advanced AI algorithms (Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning)
- Maintain modern JavaScript standards (ES2022) with comprehensive testing
- Enable seamless collaboration between human developers and AI agents

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v16.0.0 or higher
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Git** for version control
- **Modern web browser** for testing

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/js-chess-engine.git
    cd js-chess-engine
    ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. **Verify setup**:
    ```bash
    npm run quality:check
    npm test
    ```

## üìã Issue-Driven Workflow

### Finding Work

1. **Browse [Open Issues](https://github.com/jane-alesi/js-chess-engine/issues)** to find tasks
2. **Look for labels**:
    - `good first issue` - Perfect for new contributors
    - `documentation` - Documentation improvements
    - `enhancement` - New features
    - `bug` - Bug fixes
    - `core` - Chess logic implementation
    - `ai` - AI engine development

### Issue Assignment

- **Comment on the issue** to express interest
- **Wait for assignment** from maintainers (especially for larger features)
- **Self-assign** for `good first issue` labeled tasks

### Development Process

1. **Create a feature branch**:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/issue-XX-description
    ```

2. **Follow the acceptance criteria** outlined in the issue

3. **Implement following coding standards** (see below)

4. **Test your changes**:

    ```bash
    npm test
    npm run quality:check
    ```

5. **Commit with descriptive messages**:

    ```bash
    git commit -m "‚ú® Implement feature X (Issue #XX)

    - Add specific functionality
    - Include comprehensive tests
    - Update documentation"
    ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Standards

### JavaScript/ES2022 Requirements

- **ES2022 Features**: Use modern JavaScript including private class fields (`#field`)
- **ES Modules**: Use `import`/`export` with `.js` extensions
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive input validation with descriptive error messages
- **Error Handling**: Use exceptions, not console output for errors

#### Code Example

```javascript
class ChessEngine {
    // Private fields for encapsulation
    #gameState;
    #currentPlayer = 'white';

    constructor() {
        this.#gameState = new GameState();
    }

    // Public getter methods for private fields
    getCurrentPlayer() {
        return this.#currentPlayer;
    }

    // Comprehensive input validation
    makeMove(fromIndex, toIndex) {
        if (typeof fromIndex !== 'number' || fromIndex < 0 || fromIndex >= 64) {
            throw new Error(`Invalid move: fromIndex ${fromIndex} must be 0-63`);
        }
        // Implementation...
    }
}
```

### Testing Requirements

- **Jest Framework** with ES module support
- **100% Test Coverage** for new features
- **Test Compatibility** - Use getter methods for private fields in tests
- **Error Path Testing** - Test all error conditions

#### Test Example

```javascript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Use getter methods
expect(piece.getType()).toBe('pawn');

// ‚ùå INCORRECT: Direct property access
expect(piece.type).toBe('pawn');
```

### Code Quality Standards

#### Automated Quality Checks

The project includes automated code quality workflows:

```bash
# Check code quality
npm run quality:check      # Check formatting and linting
npm run lint:check         # ESLint with zero warnings
npm run format:check       # Prettier formatting check

# Fix code quality issues
npm run quality:fix        # Auto-fix formatting and linting
npm run lint:fix           # Fix ESLint issues
npm run format             # Apply Prettier formatting
```

#### Quality Gates

All contributions must pass:

1. **ESLint** - No errors or warnings
2. **Prettier** - Consistent code formatting
3. **Jest Tests** - 100% test success rate
4. **Security Audit** - No known vulnerabilities

### Architecture Guidelines

#### Module Structure

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/          # Chess logic (Board, Piece, GameState, MoveGenerator)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/            # User interface (BoardRenderer, InputHandler, styles)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ai/            # AI engine (Evaluation, Search, OpeningBook)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/         # Utilities (Constants, FEN, PGN, Notation)
```

#### Design Principles

- **Single Responsibility** - Each class/module has one clear purpose
- **Dependency Injection** - Avoid tight coupling between modules
- **Immutable State** - Game states should be immutable for AI search
- **Performance** - Optimize for move generation and AI search speed
