# JS Chess Engine

This repository contains a pure JavaScript implementation of a chess engine, inspired by the classic Atari Video Chess. The project aims to provide a clear, modular, and well-documented codebase for a playable chess game with an AI opponent.

## Project Goals

- Implement all chess rules and piece movements from scratch.
- Develop an AI opponent using search algorithms like Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning.
- Create a responsive and intuitive user interface for playing chess in a web browser.
- Provide a robust and testable codebase for future enhancements and learning.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (for development dependencies and scripts)
- A modern web browser

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jane-alesi/js-chess-engine.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
    ```bash
    cd js-chess-engine
    ```
3. Install NPM packages
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

To run the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Then open your browser to `http://localhost:8080` (or the port indicated by your server).
